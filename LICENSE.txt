License text can go here:
*Basic sharing-positive Licenses for CODE*
Unlicense - anyone can take and use this mod without giving credit or restriction
MIT - share but also give credit to previous coders
GPL_v3 - shared at the end of a gun! if *changes* are made, new code is shared too! (using is complicated)

Restrictive licenses come in many forms:
-no license listed on mod page or mod of unknown origin and nothing in zip
bobs
"I own this and you aren't allowed to do anything"
Usually permit distributing the mod, but not changes / adaptations / "work derived from"


Copyrights!
-made for texts / graphics / sounds / "assets" / "resources" etc
-code licenses are often similar
-usually focus more on commercial aspects / "adaptations" / "derivatives"
- Creative Commons licenses are common and have many different restrictions and permissions

Generally speaking:
1) ALWAYS check original mods before using code and licenses (some are 100% restrictive, many are MIT, some are Unlicense)
2) Factorio assets can be used and adapted, for use in Factorio, but use is ruled by Wube / Factorio team
3) Licensing is important, but not often a problem until somebody raises a concern
4) similar licenses and less restrictive licenses are easiest to follow
